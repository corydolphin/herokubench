{"name":"Herokubench","tagline":"Distributed benchmark and load testing tool using Heroku's free cloud","body":"### Heroku Bench.\r\nHerokubench allows you to easily load test websites, from the cloud, for free. Use hundreds of free dynos on Heroku to run apache-bench, in the same way you would run it locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n```sh\r\n$ gem install herokubench\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nUsing HerokuBench is as easy as using apache bench. The interface is the same, but the actions are distributed!\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ hbench ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://www.google.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Making it rain\r\nHerokuBench shines when running a load test with thousands of requests per second. Unlike running apache-bench from your own PC, Hbench distributes the requests across a number of dynos, allowing far higher throughput. Testing with 10,000 concurrent connections is the same as testing with 100.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ hbench ab -c 10000 -n 1000 http://www.google.com/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example Result\r\n```\r\nhbench ab -c 1000 -n 10000 http://nodejssimple.herokuapp.com/\r\n\r\n        Cumulative results, summed across dynos\r\n        Server Port:         80\r\n        Document Length:     12\r\n        Concurrency Level:   1000\r\n        Time taken for tests: 7.1\r\n        Complete requests:   10000\r\n        Failed requests:     2\r\n        Write errors:        0\r\n        Total transferred:   1321134\r\n        HTML transferred:    119976\r\n        Requests per second: 1473.7\r\n        Time per request:    7.1\r\n        Transfer rate:       21.03\r\n\r\n        Connection Times (ms), median across dynos\r\n                             min      mean     [+/-sd]  median\r\n        Connect:             1.3      3.0      3.5      1.6\r\n        Processing:          185.9    641.1    427.7    481.1\r\n        Waiting:             185.3    641.0    427.7    481.0\r\n        Total:               190.9    644.2    428.0    483.3\r\n\r\n        Percentage of the requests served within a certain time (ms) across dynos\r\n          50%                  551\r\n          66%                  671\r\n          75%                  854\r\n          80%                  1022\r\n          90%                  1514\r\n          95%                  1561\r\n          98%                  1777\r\n          99%                  3422\r\n          100%                 7219\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
